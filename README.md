This GitHub repo includes two main datasets, namely ETTO and EToCVD which are collections of eye-tracking data to be used for research purposes on visual attention, visual saliency and, more generally computer vision tasks. 

ETTO stands for Eye-Tracking Through Objects, it may want to represent a collection of eye-movement data over images containing objects and having homogeneous backgrounds. 

EToCVD (Eye-Tracking of Colour Vision Deficiencies) was built to gather eye-movements over a sequence of still images with people with and without Colour Vision Deficiencies. 

More details are provided in the Dataset Folders.

# saliency

The above mentioned Eye-tracking datasets have been used to conduct experimental session and works on Visual Saliency. 
They have been published in various journal and/or conference papers.
